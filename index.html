      <h2>About</h2>
      <h1>Hello, my name is Keith Duke.</h1>

      <p>I am a full-stack engineer with over 13 years of experience working in
       the industry at scale. For a decade I served as a full-stack engineer focused
        on web technologies for
        <a href="https://cbsinteractive.com/about/">CBS Interactive/Paramount</a>
        as both a Lead and Senior on numerous brands. I have worked with most
        delivery technologies, such as...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>JavaScript/TypeScript with Node and Vue/Nuxt, React/Next, Vite and Astro.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Python with Django, FastAPI and Flask.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>PHP with Laravel, CodeIgniter and Zend.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>CSS with Sass, BEM and major frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I completed my Bachelor of Arts in
        <a href="https://www.academyart.edu/academics/web-design/">Web Design & New Media</a>
        at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. I previously
        completed coursework in <a href="https://mtsu.edu/csc/">Computer Science</a>
        at Middle Tennessee State University. I have a background and love for
        craft and restoration, having worked professionally in wood and glass
        restoration. I fancy myself a writer,
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522828/is-code-for-computers-or-for-people">coding
          is an act of writing to two audiences</a>.
