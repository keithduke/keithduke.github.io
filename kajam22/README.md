# kajam22

Panic! at the Pepper Patch! A spicy kajam!

It's harvest time down on the farm, and those cayenne peppers and ready to run!
Press space or tap your touch screen to jump over the chickens who will slow you down
and enable the farmer to catch you. Good thing those pesky birds also slow him down!

I built this at a size to enable mobile play, and I intended for it to be played
on a phone. You will need to rotate your phone to landscape.
